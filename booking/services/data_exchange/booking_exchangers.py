"""Booking entity exchangers for the S46 data-exchange seam (S46.6).

Exposes booking reservations through the core ``EntityExchanger`` contract so
they appear on the generic Settings → Import/Export page and the per-list
controls — coexisting with the existing booking admin export/import services
(which produce CSV *reports* keyed on resource/category, a different shape).

Entity:

* ``bookings`` (``Booking``, natural key ``id``) — import+export.

  Natural key note (flagged): the ``Booking`` model has **no** human booking
  reference column — its only stable identifier is the UUID ``id``. So this
  exchanger is a same-instance backup/restore (export → wipe → import by ``id``
  reproduces the row, including its ``resource_id`` / ``user_id`` /
  ``invoice_id`` FKs, which remain valid on the same instance). Cross-instance
  portability would require a real booking reference; out of scope for v1.

Design notes:

* **Reused perms** — the plugin already ships ``booking.bookings.view`` /
  ``booking.bookings.manage``; the exchanger maps ``export_permission`` /
  ``import_permission`` onto those (single source of truth).
* **PII** — the customer's name/email/phone/company are resolved on the fly from
  the ``User`` / ``UserDetails`` rows (not stored on the booking), so the
  exported row carries no customer PII columns. The free-text ``notes`` /
  ``admin_notes`` may hold customer-entered text, so they are declared
  ``pii_fields`` and redacted unless the caller holds the PII permission.
* **DRY** — reuses :class:`BaseModelExchanger`; only the narrow
  ``_SessionModelRepository`` adapter is added (mirrors core / CMS).
* **No core change** — registration happens in ``BookingPlugin.on_enable``
  through the shared ``db.session``; core imports no ``plugins.*`` module.

S89.1 (load-test bulk seed) for ``bookings`` — now shipped (Slice B):

``bookings`` does not fit the slug-prefix seam the flat shop/subscription
catalog rows use, for two structural reasons. Both are handled with plugin-side
overrides only — **no core change**:

* ``Booking``'s natural key is the **UUID ``id``**, not a settable slug. The base
  ``bulk_seed`` writes ``loadtest-bookings-<i>`` into the natural-key column and
  matches the ``loadtest-`` prefix for idempotency + ``--reset``; a UUID column
  cannot hold that string. :class:`_BookingsExchanger` overrides
  ``_loadtest_natural_key`` to emit a **deterministic UUID5** (fixed namespace +
  ``loadtest-bookings-<index>``) so the same index always maps to the same id —
  idempotency + ``--reset`` work by id, recomputable for any count.
* A ``Booking`` also requires a non-null ``user_id`` FK into the core
  ``vbwd_user`` table plus a valid ``resource_id`` and time slot. The seed
  provisions **one shared ``loadtest-`` ``BookableResource``** through the
  booking resource repository (no raw SQL) and **reuses an existing user** read
  from the core ``User`` table (the plugin already reads ``vbwd_user`` to
  resolve booking customers — it never *creates* a core user). Load-test
  bookings are identified by their FK to that one resource (a stable, queryable
  marker on a column the model already has), so ``--reset`` drops exactly those
  reservations + the resource when unreferenced, never touching real rows.

Engineering requirements (binding, restated): TDD-first; DevOps-first; SOLID
(one exchanger, narrow port); DI (session injected); DRY; Liskov; clean code;
no overengineering. Quality guard: ``bin/pre-commit-check.sh --plugin booking
--full``.
